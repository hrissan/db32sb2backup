# db32sb2backup
Tool to convert db3 SmartBudget database extracted from iTunes backup to backup format which could be open by SmartBudget 2

After upgrade to iOS 14 some users report that Smart Budget 2 crashes after launch.

Thos users can extract .db3 databases using Iphone Backup Extractor tool, but they are in internal SmartBudget 2 format.

This tool converts those .db3 files to .sb2backup files that can be opened by Smart Budget on the same or different device after reinstalling.
